### Buyer
1.  Positions are taken from 1 to 5 (to avoid sniping).
2.  Call your position close the thread and reopen it before taking to avoid double donations
3.	If a spot is sniped, the GB owner is responsible for compensating any net loss to all donors affected. Mistakes happen if anyone adds extra you must offer to pay back.
4. please repost the wait list minus your spot once spot is taken

4. Add your offer to the existing waitlist
5. Positions should be announced from highest to lowest
6. Positions should include cost to purchase
