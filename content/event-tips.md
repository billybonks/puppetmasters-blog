Tips for events
===============

Events are usually highly beneficiary for most players. They are a source of decent to great rewards. The most rewarding is usually the event building. This building usually provides coins, supplies, population, happiness, attack bonus and forge points. These benefits are usually tacked on gradually by applying upgrade kits. An event building usually takes a bit of space, so for max efficiency you should always strive to get it to the highest level.

On key to success in an event is to solve the questline as quickly as possible. In an event, the questline is usually devided in two parts, the main questline and the daily questline. The main questline is also known as the rush-quests. These can usually be done in a couple of days. The daily quests are released one each day from the event starts, but they are not available before finishing the main questline.

Preparations
------------

### Free space

Some quests in the event questline requires you to build new buildings. And many of the tips here also involves building ned buildings temporarily. Thus, to be able to run through the questline quickly, you need some extra space. Of course, the more the better. I've usually done well with 2-3 expansions, preferably next to eachother. Other "holes" already present in the town can also be utilized.

### Blacksmiths

You should have a minimum of production buildings ready before the event starts. Blacksmiths are small and cheap, but they count as any other when you are asked to complete a 8-hour production 20 times. I try to keep at least 12 production buildings during the event including the regular ones.

### Plan the quests

Go through the quests and make a plan. In some quests you can choose what task to perform, have a look at the next couple of quests to comfirm your choice is not putting you at a disadvantage later. Identify what quests that will slow you down, so that you can plan when to aid, visit taverns, collecting incidents and collecting silver. You don't want to miss incidents, since they might provide event currency, but you don't want to wait for them when the quests arrive.

Quests
------

Quests usually contains 2-3 tasks. The tasks are normally one of the following.

### Goods-related

#### Task: "Donate _x_ Goods to the guild treasury"

Straight forward. You can donate to the guild treasury in the Guild window. This is not a waste, as goods are required to unlock level 2 and above in the guild expeditions and the Guild can buy buildings in the Guild Battlegrounds.

The amount varies by age/era.

There are some buildings that donates to the treasury hen collecting from them. Unfortunately not all of these will count toward completion of this task.

Building

Observatory

Arc

Statue of Honor

Yes

Airship

Yes

#### Task: "Gather x goods, e.g. From goods buildings or by trading"

The amount varies by age/era.

The key here is _trading_. In _the guild_ we have a thread called "Quest trades". Here you post back-and-for-trades.

Example: If you are asked to gather 210 goods, make four trades of 30 Bricks for 30 Glass, and then the reverse 4 trades of 30 Glass for 30 Bricks. Even though it is enough to do 3 trades of the last one to get to 210, we should always keep these trades balanced.

Mark your trades as guild-only to reduce the risk of someone else taking just one side of the trade-pairs.

### Coins / supplies

#### Task: "Gather _x_ coins" / "Gather _x_ supplies"

Be aware, these ones might delay your questline progress!

There are many ways to collect both coins and supplies:

*   Collect from Houses/Productions buildings
*   Collect from event buildings
*   Collect from great buildings, like the Cathedral of Aachen
*   Do encounters in the Guild Expedition
*   Aquire provinces on the Continent Map
*   Complete other quests (also in Settlements)
*   Sell buildings (you usually get 20%-30% of what you paid to build it)
*   Collect incidents (usually very small amounts)

If you time you collection, by not collecting before this quest, that would probably be the most efficient way to deal with these. Consider using using Boost-bottles. Remember that you cannot cancel Tavern boosts, and you cannot activate more at once (without spending diamonds), so you will block quests that asks you to active boosts in this time. Bottles do not block.

#### Task: "Pay _x_ coins" / "Pay _x_ supplies"

Click to pay, that's all

#### Task: "In a production building, finish a _15-minute_ production _x_ times"

The smaller the production time, the faster this one will be solved. These quests are most likely to block your progress if you don't plan for them. This is why we have prepared by making blacksmiths.

Note that the task only asks to finish a production, so start it long before the quest arrives. One trick you can do with the blacksmiths is to prepare i.e. a couple of 8-hour productions, then take them off-road. They cannot be accidentially collected from or plundered in this time. You can stick them in empty spots in your city, ready to move back and open when you need the 8-hour productions.

Do especially look out for long productions that comes right after a series of short productions. Consider setting aside a few production buildings for the short productions and do them sequentially, but make sure you have enough long ones.

In my experience, productions in event-building like the Terrace Farm counts, even if they are producing something else than supplies for the given duration.

#### Task: "Finish 15 productions in a production buildings from your age" / "Finish 18 productions in a production buildings from the previous age"

Plan ahead, and this should not be a problem. Use 5-minutes productions and you'll be done quickly.

### Building / Population / Happiness

#### Task: "Build 2 residential buildings from your age" / "Build 3 residential buildings from the previous age"

Find a cheap residental-building for the apropriate age, then build and sell. You don't have to wait for the building to finish and you can build again in the same spot. If you have space, consider not selling at once, as it might give you coins in a near-future quest.

#### Task: "Build 4 decorations from your age" / "Build 6 decorations from the previous age"

Find a cheap decoration for the apropriate age, then build and sell. You don't have to wait for the building to finish and you can build again in the same spot. If you have space, consider not selling at once, as it might give you coins in a near-future quest. Otherwise, sell at once. Decorations are not recommended.

#### Task: "Gain _x_ total population"

Find a house that is cheap and quick to build, like the Stilt House from the Bronze Age. Build and sell over and over again. You have to wait until the house is completed to gain the population. Population lost by selling are not counted.

#### Task: "Gain _x_ happiness"

The Memorial from the Stone age are very cheap, and takes only 2s to build. Build and sell. You need to wait both of the 2 seconds to gain the happiness before selling it. Don't keep them, as they are a waste of space and aid.

#### Task: "Make people enthusiastic"

The best would be to always have your people enthusiastic. If they are not, consider using self-aid kits or selling excess houses. Alternativly build a cultural building if you have in your inventory.

#### Task: "Build _x_ goods buildings from your age"

Goods buildings are usually more expensive than houses and production buildings. If you are planning to extends your goods production, now is the time. Remember that you just have to start the construction within this task, you can sell it at once if you want.

### Friends and neighborhood

#### Task: "Motivate or polish _x_ buildings of other players"

Be aware that if you click aid and the player does not have any buildings to motivate or polish, it will not count towards this task.

Remember that you can only aid you friends, guildies and neigbors once every 24 hours, so have a look at the questline before any aiding/visiting during the event.

#### Task: "Visit _x_ Friends Taverns"

You can only visit your friends taverns once every 23 hours, and only if your friends are collecting the silver. Have a look at the questline and plan when to visit. If you don't think you'll get to a quest like this for 24 hours, you should visit all your friends, since they might be blocked on a silver-collection-quest.

#### Task: "Collect _x_ Tavern Silver"

Be aware of your collection. Consider holding the collection until this quest arrives. But remember that noone can visit you when your tavern is full, and your friends might be on a visit-tavern-quest.

#### Task: "Spend _x_ Tavern Silver in the Friends Tavern"

This is a perfect time to do some upgrades in your tavern. If you have a fully upgraded tavern, you have to use boosts. Remeber that activating a boost is blocking your tavern for boost-quest for the given duration.

#### Task: "Activate _x_ boosts in the Friends Tavern"

You can only activate 1 boost at the time. An extra turn for GE takes only 15 minutes. Consider having a go in the GE at the same time.

### Guild expedition / Continent map / Army / Negotation

#### Task: "Recruit _x_ units from your age"

Actually recruiting units might take a while. Some times it is quicker doing some encounters in the Guild Expedition or playing in the event, hoping to win units. You can also win units in Guild Battle Grounds, but that is less likely. Units can also be bought in the Antique Dealer.

### Forge points

#### Task: "Buy _x_ Forge Points"

Keep in mind that you cannot buy forge points when your FP-bar is full.
